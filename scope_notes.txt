namespace is a mapping from names to objects.

Scope is the portion of the program from where a namespace can be accessed directly without any prefix.

When a reference is made inside a function, the name is searched in the local namespace, then in the global namespace and finally in the built-in namespace.


1) For variable defined in local of a (inner)function, outside of inner function, and inside main 
scope for writing:1) local(inner function) 2)nonlocal(in outer function) 3)global(in main )

2) For variable in inner function - nonlocal and global are read only. For using nonlocal variable, (inner)function has to declare it as nonlocal var. Then it becomes writable inside that function.

3) For variable in outer function - global variable is read only. For modifying it, declare as global var.


scopes of variables;
1) Local variable -
Local variable are the variable that are defined inside function. And its scope is limited upto that function only.

2) Nonlocal variable -
Nonlocal variable are used in nested function(local to outside function). scope is between local and global.

3) global variable -
global variable are defined outside of function and are accessible throughout that module.
