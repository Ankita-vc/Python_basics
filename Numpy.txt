what is numpy -
NumPy, short for Numerical Python, is the fundamental package required for high performance scientific computing and data analysis.

Numpy (Numerical Python) Arrays:

1)In a NumPy array, the number of dimensions is called the rank, and each dimension is called an axis. So the rows are the first axis, and the columns are the second axis.

2)We can create a NumPy array using the numpy.array function.

3) NumPy will automatically pick a data type for the elements in an array based on their format.

4) NumPy is a package for working with multidimensional arrays. 

5) NumPy stores values using its own data types, which are distinct from Python types like float and str.  This is because the core of NumPy is written in a programming language called C, which stores data differently than the Python data types. NumPy data types map between Python and C,


why numpy is faster than normal python?
(vectorization in array operations, memory management, something related to c....) -
details---

Python for loops are inherently slower than their C counterpart.

This is why numpy offers vectorized actions on numpy arrays. It pushes the for loop you would usually do in Python down to the C level, which is much faster. numpy offers vectorized ("C level for loop") alternatives to things that otherwise would need to be done in an element-wise manner ("Python level for loop).

Arrays are important because they enable you to express batch operations on data without writing any for loops. This is usually called vectorization. Any arithmetic operations between equal-size arrays applies the operation elementwise.

 limitations of NumPy:

 1) all the elements in an array have to be of the same type, so if we include the header row (all of string type), all the elements in the array will be read in as strings.
