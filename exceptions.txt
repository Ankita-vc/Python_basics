1)  In Python, an error can be a syntax error or an exception.
2) exception error. This type of error occurs whenever syntactically correct Python code results in an error. 
3) Raise an exception: 

We can use raise to throw an exception if a condition occurs. The statement can be complemented with a custom exception.
If you want to throw an error when a certain condition occurs using raise, you could go about it like this:

x = 10
if x > 5:
    raise Exception('x should not exceed 5. The value of x was: {}'.format(x))

4)The AssertionError Exception:

An AssertionError can only occur when an assert statement fails. Therefore, an AssertionError should never be a surprise or appear in a section of your application code that is unexpected â€” every time you write an assert statement, you should also provide appropriate exception handling code to deal with an inevitable assert failure.

use:
When we want to fail the program if a particular condition is not met, rather than crashing the code in the middle..we can assert a condition at start only.

5)User defined exception:

In Python, users can define such exceptions by creating a new class. This exception class has to be derived, either directly or indirectly, from Exception class.
